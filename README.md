## Data Structures

- ### Arrays
    - Implement an automatically resizing vector.
    - [ ] Description:
        - [Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/arrays-OsBSF)
        - [Basic Arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/02_04-basicArrays.mp4)

        - [Resizing arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/03_01-resizableArrays.mp4)
    - [ ] Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing):
        - [ ] Practice coding using arrays and pointers, and pointer math to jump to an index instead of using indexing.
        - [ ] New raw data array with allocated memory
            - can allocate int array under the hood, just not use its features
            - start with 16, or if starting number is greater, use power of 2 - 16, 32, 64, 128
        - [ ] size() - number of items
        - [ ] capacity() - number of items it can hold
        - [ ] is_empty()
        - [ ] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
        - [ ] push(item)
        - [ ] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
        - [ ] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
        - [ ] pop() - remove from end, return value
        - [ ] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
        - [ ] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
        - [ ] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
        - [ ] resize(new_capacity) // private function
            - when you reach capacity, resize to double the size
            - when popping an item, if size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half
    - [ ] Time
        - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
        - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
    - [ ] Space
        - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
        - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)

- ### Linked Lists
    - [ ] Description:
        - [ ] [Singly Linked Lists (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/singly-linked-lists-kHhgK)
        - [ ] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 1 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_htzJdKoEmO0)
        - [ ] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 2 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_-c4I3gFYe3w)
    - [ ] [C Code (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN6FPiD0Gzo)
            - not the whole video, just portions about Node struct and memory allocation.
    - [ ] Linked List vs Arrays:
        - [Core Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures-optimizing-performance/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays-rjBs9)
        - [In The Real World Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures-optimizing-performance/in-the-real-world-lists-vs-arrays-QUaUd)
    - [ ] [why you should avoid linked lists (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo)
    - [ ] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.
        - [Pointers to Pointers](https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx8.html)
    - [ ] Implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
        - [ ] size() - returns number of data elements in list
        - [ ] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [ ] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [ ] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [ ] pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
        - [ ] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
        - [ ] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [ ] front() - get value of front item
        - [ ] back() - get value of end item
        - [ ] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
        - [ ] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [ ] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list
        - [ ] reverse() - reverses the list
        - [ ] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value
    - [ ] Doubly-linked List
        - [Description (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/doubly-linked-lists-jpGKD)
        - No need to implement

- ### Stack
    - [ ] [Stacks (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/stacks-UdKzQ)
    - [ ] [Using Stacks Last-In First-Out (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/05_01-usingStacksForLast-inFirst-out.mp4)
    - [ ] Will not implement. Implementing with array is trivial.

- ### Queue
    - [ ] [Using Queues First-In First-Out(video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/05_03-usingQueuesForFirst-inFirst-out.mp4)
    - [ ] [Queue (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/queues-EShpq)
    - [ ] [Circular buffer/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
    - [ ] [Priority Queues (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/05_04-priorityQueuesAndDeques.mp4)
    - [ ] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()
    - [ ] Implement using fixed-sized array:
        - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
        - empty()
        - full()
    - [ ] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

    - [ ] Implement with array using linear probing

        - add(key, value) - if key already exists, update value
        - exists(key)
        - get(key)
        - remove(key)

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes:
    - There are 4 basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - adjacency matrix
        - adjacency list
        - adjacency map
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their trade offs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none.

- ### Dynamic Programming
    - You probably won't see any dynamic programming problems in your interview, but it's worth being able to recognize a problem as being a candidate for dynamic programming.
    - This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky.
    - I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.

## System Design, Scalability, Data Handling

**You can expect system design questions if you have 4+ years of experience.**

- Scalability and System Design are very large topics with many topics and resources, since
      there is a lot to consider when designing a software/hardware system that can scale.
      Expect to spend quite a bit of time on this.
- Considerations:
    - scalability
        - Distill large data sets to single values
        - Transform one data set to another
        - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
    - system design
        - features sets
        - interfaces
        - class hierarchies
        - designing a system under certain constraints
        - simplicity and robustness
        - tradeoffs
        - performance analysis and optimization

- [ ] Practicing the system design process: Here are some ideas to try working through on paper, each with some documentation on how it was handled in the real world:
    - review: [The System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
    - [System Design from HiredInTech](http://www.hiredintech.com/system-design/)
    - [cheat sheet](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/extras/cheat%20sheets/system-design.pdf)
    - flow:
        1. Understand the problem and scope:
            - define the use cases, with interviewer's help
            - suggest additional features
            - remove items that interviewer deems out of scope
            - assume high availability is required, add as a use case
        2. Think about constraints:
            - ask how many requests per month
            - ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
            - estimate reads vs. writes percentage
            - keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
            - how much data written per second
            - total storage required over 5 years
            - how much data read per second
        3. Abstract design:
            - layers (service, data, caching)
            - infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
            - rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
            - consider bottlenecks and determine solutions

- ### Balanced search trees
    - Know at least one type of balanced binary tree (and know how it's implemented):
    - "Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now passé, and red-black trees seem to be more popular.
        A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations
        to move any accessed key to the root." - Skiena
    - Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a
        balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up
        and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code.
        - splay tree: insert, search, delete functions
        If you end up implementing red/black tree try just these:
        - search and insertion functions, skipping delete
    - I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets.
    - [ ] [Self-balancing binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree)

    - **AVL trees**
        - In practice:
            From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be:
            The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly
            balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it
            attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language
            dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter).

    - **Splay trees**
        - In practice:
            Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors,
            data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory,
            networking and file system code) etc.

    - **Red/black trees**
        - These are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below).
        - In practice:
            Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.
            Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,
            but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees;
            for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and
            the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java,
            the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor
            hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.

    - **2-3 search trees**
        - In practice:
            2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).
        - You would use 2-3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red Black trees.

    - **2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)**
        - In practice:
            For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion
            operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an
            important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce
            2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though **2-4 trees are not often used in practice**.

    - **N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees**
        - note: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)
        - binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2

    - **B-Trees**
        - Fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor).
        - In Practice:
            B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to
            its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary
            block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block
            (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address.
